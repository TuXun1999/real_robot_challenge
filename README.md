This repo is for P7, real robot challenge in Csci 5551, Spring 2024, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. If you want to use the programs in it, be sure to complete Part I ahead, where you install necessary packages to control the turtlebot. 
In addition, you will need two packages to read data from the camera:
1. pyrealsense: run "pip install pyrealsense"
